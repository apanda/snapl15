\section{Introduction}

Software defined networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture for
operating and managing computer networks, fueled by adoption by major
technology companies~\cite{SIGCOMM:Jain13}.
SDN spawns a lot of recent interest in the programming language and the verification communities in order to facilitate effective construction of
reliable networks (e.g., \cite{FlowLog,monsanto2012compiler,Verificare,FMACAD:SNM13,VeiCon,Majumdar:2014}).
We argue that \textbf{all} these works are doomed to fail due to the presence of middleboxes.
We study potential ways to enable the verification of SDNs with middleboxes and show why middleboxes are actually a good programming abstraction which
can be used for compositional verification.
