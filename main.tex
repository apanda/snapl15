% We define some future challenges for programming language techniques for verifying computer networks.
% We argue that some of the issues in computer networks such as efficient routing are well understood
% and require less attention.
% Also we list some functionality of computer networks such as intrusion detection which
% is not amenable to automatic program verification.
% In contrast, we identify essential network properties such as network isolation which are crucial for network functionality. Moreover, these properties can be violated by network miss-configuration errors.
% As a result, network administrators tends to configure networks in an overly-conservative way leading to
% huge resource consumption.
% Therefore, program verification can have a great impact on future networks by developing compile-time
% and run-time methods which will enforce these properties, thereby, leading to more effective networking.

% \section*{Outline}
% \begin{outline}
% \1 Section 1: Introduction
%     \2 Verification done first for hardware, and now becoming more common for software
%         \3 But only recently have verification techniques been applied to networks
%         \3 These verification techniques have, for the first time, given us confidence that network configurations will produce ``correct" behavior.
%     \2 However, current verification work assumes statelessness (2 pages)
%         \3 Not representative of real networks
%         \3 Techniques cannot generalize to stateful networks
%         \3 Therefore, this is a dead-end
%     \2 Challenge we pose: how to verify stateful (i.e., real) networks? (3 pages)
%         \3 There are two main technical challenges
% \1 Section 2: Challenge \#1: How to model middleboxes? (to make feasible)
%     \2 Naive approach (of just verifying the code in each box) doesn't work
%         \3 Practical problem: large proprietary codebases, we'll never get them to verify
%         \3 Conceptual problem: what are you trying to verify?
%     \2 Operator's goals specified in terms of abstractions:
%         \3 Suspicious packets
%         \3 Packets belonging to a specific application
%         \3 Packets associated with a specific identify
%         \3 in-cache or not
%         \3 Etc.
%     \2 These abstractions usually not well defined
%         \3 And very implementation-specific (e.g., application identification, caching policy) and context-specific (identities)
%         \3 Much of the middlebox code is dedicated to implementing these abstractions
%     \2 To provide reasonable verification, we model middleboxes as being comprised of a Generic piece and an Oracle
%         \3 Generic: captures the basic logic in terms of these abstractions
%             \4 A reasonably small set of these, models can be developed without seeing the code
%         \3 Oracle: provides the mapping between packets/flows and a subset of these abstractions
%             \4 Specifies the set of abstractions implemented by the middlebox.
%             \4 We assume that the Oracle is correct in our verification.
%             \4 And consider it a separable problem to improve the behavior of the code devoted to these tasks
%             \4 cite Katerina (Doesn't quite verify these details, but close.)
%             \4 specify correctness condition, range of domain of oracle, etc.
%     \2 This approach has several advantages
%         \3 Generic models are both descriptive and enforceable
%         \3 Generic models can be easily developed
%         \3 Changes ecosystem
%             \4 Models come with mboxes, enable carrier checking
%         \3 But we need to specify invariants in order to know what level of abstractions....
%             \4 Reachability, isolation, (in terms of abstractions)....easy
%             \4 Correlations, ....easy
%             \4 Domain of Oracles
%             \4 Networks don't do much....don't worry about what we can't verify.
% \1 Section 3: Challenge \#2: How to analyze resulting network? (to make feasible)
%     \2 RONO (fill in details)
% \1 Section 4: Myths [Bad thing known by PL paper]
%     \2 Declarative languages are not a panacea for networking
%     \2 Reactive and proactive are not the only solutions.
%     \2 Centralization is not the answer.
%     \2 SDN is the only way to do verification \notepanda{I think we haave to be a bit careful}
%     \2 Learning switches and stateuful firewalls are ideally implemented in the controller
%     \2 Middleboxes are an abomination
% \1 Section 4: Things that are interesting from a PL and verification perspective
%     % \2 \fixme{Huh?} Cite DeMillo paper.... \fixme{Is this http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf, doesn't it just say we are screwed}
%     \2 Formal semantics of a middlebox
%         \3 function from packet and history to a set of possible located packets.
%         \3 \fixme{Why Absract Middleboxes}
%     \2 Formal definition of verification problems
%         \3 Network isolation: common, important class of network invariants.
%         \3 Complexity of checking correctness.
%     \2 Compositional reasoning.
%         \2 Middleboxes as ADTs
%         \2 RONO as a first step to compositionality.
%         \2 Correctness preserving transformation: can we add or remove middleboxes without affecting correctness?
%     % \2 Think of MBoxes as ADTs (nice properties: modularity)
%     %     \3 Mboxes used to be seen as "hacks", but they should be seen as units of modularity
%     % \2 MBox models should use uninterpreted functions (so we don't need to model implementations, just generic functionality)
%     %     \3 This is how invariants will be expressed
%     %     \3 This is the natural way to build simple models
%     % \2 RONO is a first step towards compositional reasoning
%     %     \3 Our invariants are RONO-complete
%     %     \3 Some invariants aren't: how can we reason compositionally about them?
