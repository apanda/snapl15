\section{Open Problems for Network Verification}
Finally, we present some open problems that we have encountered while looking at how to verify mutable dataplanes. This list is not 
exhaustive, but is rather an attempt to list the first set of hurdles that need to be crossed given this new network verification agenda.

\textbf{Decidability of Verification} 
When processing a packet, a middlebox might access potentially unbounded state. This prevents the use
of finite-state model checking, and other verification techniques are undecidable for general programs in this class. We are
currently working on a limited programming language that is rich enough to specify all exiting middleboxes, while simultaneously
enabling verification of some interesting network properties, including reachability properties.

% Our abstract models for middleboxes such Firewall an IDSs have infinite state.
% Therefore, in general it may be undecidable to check properties like network isolation.
% We are currently working on a programming language for specifying abstract middleboxes, which allows to algorithmically check
% interesting network properties, including network isolation.


\textbf{Specification}
Specifying verification properties and middleboxes remains an open question in general. While we have provided some tools
that allow us to specify and check reachability properties, extending this to other invariants, for example performance based
invariants remains challenging. How middleboxes and properties are specified also has a huge impact on verification time and
decidability. Therefore, it is crucial to pick specifications that are rich enough to permit operators to express interesting and
useful properties, yet narrow enough to permit automated reasoning.

\textbf{Correctness Preserving Transformations and Parametric Toplogies}
It might be possible to extend some of our results on compositional reasoning to show that the addition of certain types of middleboxes
can never affect some class of invariants. We know this is true for some middleboxes in reality, the addition of a stateless firewall
can never affect an isolation invariant (though it might invalidate some reachability invariants). Developing a theory for when this 
holds might be useful in developing techniques to help simplify network changes. 

Compositional verification similarly hints at the fact that we might be able to design some ``parametric'' topologies, where one can provably
show that a change to one network path cannot possibly affect another. It is easy to see that this is easily achieved for stateless datapaths.
However, the complexity of what can built using parametric toplogies, when mutable data paths are used remains an open question.
